## Project Description
Using JavaScript and Node.js, this program converts 32-bit bitmap images to greyscale, blackout (all black pixels), and inverted colors. :art: Using our code as a base, you can also create your own image conversions or custom filters by adjusting our transform.js file.

### Features:
+ Convert 3 images at one time
+ 3 filters:
  + Blackout: Creates all black pixels for every pixel in the image
  + Greyscale: Creates a greyscale version of the image
  + Inverted Colors: Creates an inversion of the image
+ Open source code with MIT license

### Installation
I literally have no idea how other people use this thing.

`npm something or other? guys we need to fill this in`

### Usage
Our program automatically creates three converted images for you, which are written into the assets file.

1. Save a 32-bitmap image to the assets folder, with the name palette-bitmap.bmp - this is the image you want to convert.
2. With Node.js installed, run in terminal:

`node index.js`

3. Converted images (greyscale, blackout, and inverted colors) are written to /assets. Enjoy!

### Our Process
We spent the first day of this project pseudo-coding our way to a solution. Once we had a solid direction in mind, we mob-programmed together for several hours to get a rough idea of how the program would take shape. On day 2, we had a rudimentary working draft and were able to work more in detail on our tranform.js file to get our methods to work and write images. Once that was up and working, we **DID SOMETHING OR OTHER**

While we would have liked to apply the TDD process on this project, we did not use it due to time constraints.

### About Us
Gavin, Michelle, and Shaun are currently taking Code 401 (Full Stack JavaScript) at Code Fellows in Seattle, WA. They constructed this project in their first week of class.
